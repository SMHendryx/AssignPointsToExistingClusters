another way to test whether another cluster belongs to a point would be to loop through the unassigned cluster centroids
and check whether or not any unassigned cluster centroid falls within the Minor_Axis radius from the predicted true cluster centroid.  
If so, "merge" clusters, compute new predicted true cluster centroid and repeat until there are no unassigned cluster centroids that fall within the Minor_Axis radius from the predicted true cluster centroid
